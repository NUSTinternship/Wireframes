## User Testing Protocol
> Hello [user's name]. I'm [your name(s)] with the [project name]. The [project name] is [project description]. Today we are looking for ways to improve the user experience of [name of item being tested ]. This is a test of the component; we are not testing you. If you find something difficult to use, chances are that others will as well, so your feedback helps everyone. This test of the component is simply a means of evaluating the component's design and to discover any issues we need to address.
Please speak all your thoughts aloud as you go through the tasks. This helps us better understand why you are making certain choices. The study will take about 30 minutes. We will answer any questions you have at the end of the study.
Do you have any questions?
